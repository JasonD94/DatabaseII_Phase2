Database II Project Instructions
Created by Jason Downing and Chris Pearce

To run our project, complete the following steps:
1. Create the database in phpMyAdmin by copying the create.sql instructions into the "SQL" tab
2. Open the "bookdb" database by clicking on the "Databases" tab
3. Populate the "bookdb" tables by copying the insert.sql instructions into the "SQL" tab
4. You can now run the index.php file, as long as all the PHP code found in /php/ is located in the same directory
as the index.php file. This file contains a UI to all 10 of queries, and links to the different php files that run
the selected query. NOTE: the index.php file is our "HTML" file, we just made it a PHP file so we could imbed PHP
scripts easily.
