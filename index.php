            has, we will only delete his author table entry.</li>
        <li>If the author has not made any purchases, we will delete his person table entry as this will completely
            delete him from the database, as our people table will cascade delete, which will also delete the
            author's author table entry as well.</li>
        <li>Delete the book now that we've searched the for the author.</li>
